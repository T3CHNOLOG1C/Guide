## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Sony. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

Running homebrew on your device is 100% free using [just the PS Vita's Web browser](running-henkaku).

## What is a Homebrew Enabler?

**Homebrew Enabler** ("HEN") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned apps that appear right on your LiveArea screen.

HEN can be easily set up on any console that is on 3.60 or lower.

## What does this guide install?

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Vita from stock firmware to a Homebrew Enabler called HENkaku.

HENkaku is currently the only feasible method for running homebrew on our PS Vita / TV systems. It will install an application that can be used to install packages and manage files called "molecularShell" which we will use to install "VitaShell", another package / file manager with more features. We will also install an offline version of HENkaku that takes advantage of the same browser exploit used by HENkaku in the email app. It gives us a way to run HENkaku even when our console is not connected to the internet.

For information on how HENkaku works, please see [this blog post](https://yifan.lu/2016/10/20/henkaku-koth-solved/) by [Yifan Lu](https://twitter.com/yifanlu).

## What can I do with a Homebrew Enabler?

+ Customize your LiveArea Screen with user-created [themes](http://vstema.com/).
+ Use "ROM hacks" for games that you own
+ [Backup, edit, and restore](https://github.com/d3m3vilurr/vita-savemgr) saves for many games.
+ Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
+ Dump your game cards to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card.
+ Certain games only: stream live gameplay to your PC wirelessly with Rincheat Streamer.
+ Play backups of your PSP games on your Vita with Adrenaline ePSP CFW

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Vita hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're very very rare and usually only happen after modifying system files, but still a possibility, however that possibility is slim to none, considering that this guide does not have you modify any critical system files.**
+ This guide will work on PS Vita, PS Vita Slim, and PSTV in all regions on firmware 3.60 or below.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, PSN Account, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ **Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!**
+ The PS Vita Slim is essentially identical to the Original PS Vita in terms of software, and that any steps which say "PS Vita" also apply to the slim model.
