title: "HENkaku Update to HENkaku Ensō 3.65"
---

#### Overview of steps
During this process, we will update your PS Vita from stock, HENkaku or HENkaku Ensō version 3.60 to HENkaku Ensō 3.65.
If you use a SD2Vita like device, you need an original Sony© Memory Card to do the update.

Software Version 3.65:
##### Pros
- You will now be able to access the PSN store, activate your device and download your purchased games again (only as long as Sony doesn't decide to release a new update that prevents you from doing that).
- You will be able to play all games that were released for firmwares 3.61-3.65.

##### Cons
- You will not be able to downgrade back to 3.60 if you find that this custom firmware doesn't suit you.
- You can lose the ability to run homebrews, if you modify the OS and end up in a semi-brick where you are forced to reinstall the firmware. This should however not happen to a regular user, but I'd rather not install applications that modify read-only partitions like `os0:` or `vs0:`.
- Some applications may not work on the new firmware and need to be ported.

#### What you need
* The latest release of [update365](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/update365/releases) (the updater.vpk)
* The firmware [image](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/update365/releases/download/v1.0/PSP2UPDAT.PUP) 3.65 for PS Vita from TheOfficialFloW's github (is needed by the update365 utility)
* An FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php)
* The latest release of [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases)
* The latest version of Content Manager Assistant for [Windows](http://cma.dl.playstation.net/cma/win/) or [MacOS](http://cma.dl.playstation.net/cma/mac/). For linux I can recommend installing a virtual machine with Windows 7-10 30 day trial and USB redirecting via virt-manager or VMware Workstation Player or install an open source implementation of cma like [qcma](https://codestation.github.io/qcma/)
* An original Sony© Memory Card for the update process. You don't loose any data and you can use it for as much devices, as you want. Before you use it with another device, unlink the Sony© Memory Card via `Settings` application -> `Henkaku Settings` -> `Unlink Memory Card` -> turn your PS Vita off -> put it into another device.

##### Optional
If you are using plugins, please download the newest version with 3.65/3.67 support to use them after the update:

* The latest release of [gamesd](https://github.com/xyzz/gamecard-microsd/releases/) if you using a SD2Vita adapter
* The latest release of [nonpdrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases)
* The latest release of [DownloadEnabler](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/DownloadEnabler/releases)
* The latest release of [Ensō Installer](https://github.com/henkaku/enso/releases/) if you have HENkaku Ensō 3.60 installed

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Backup VitaShell
It is highly recommended that you create a CMA Backup for ``VitaShell`` to restore it, if anything goes wrong after the 3.65 update. You can skip this step, but in emergency case you have to restore ``VitaShell`` with [psvimgtools](https://github.com/yifanlu/psvimgtools) which is much more complicated than restoring a CMA Backup.
1. Update VitaShell to *1.82* or higher via the ``*.vpk``. If you get an error when trying to install the vpk, simply rename the ``vpk`` to ``zip``, extract the ``zip`` and manually copy the **eboot.bin** file to ``ux0:app/VITASHELL/eboot.bin``
1. Start VitaShell and check if it has version *1.82* or newer
1. Install Content Manager Assistant for Windows or MacOS
1. Connect your PS Vita via USB cable and start the `Content Manager` application on your PS Vita. If you don't have a Playstation Network© account create one (dummy account for safety) and login with it. Select `Copy Content` and after that choose `Copy Content` `PS Vita System` -> `PC`
1. Choose `Applications` -> `PS Vita` -> `VitaShell` and press `Copy`
1. Exit the `Content Manager` application

1. Turn your PS Vita off
1. Remove your SD2Vita from your gamecard slot and insert your original Sony© Memory Card to the memory card slot
1. Turn your PS Vita on and format your orginal Sony© Memory Card if neccessary
1. If you have formatted it, restore VitaShell via `Content Manager`
 + Connect your PS Vita via USB cable and start the `Content Manager` application on your PS Vita. Select `Copy Content` and after that choose `Copy Content` `PS Vita System` -> `PC` -> `Applications` -> `PS Vita` -> `VitaShell` and press `Copy`
1. Exit `Content Manager` and start `VitaShell`

##### Optional - Section IV - Uninstall Ensō
If you have HENkaku Ensō installed, follow these steps. If not, proceed to Section V.

##### Section V - Run the update
1. Start HENkaku via browser on [http://henkaku.xyz/go/](http://henkaku.xyz/go/)
1. Start VitaShell and copy the ``ur0:tai/config.txt`` to ``ux0:config.txt``. (be sure you copy it to the memory card ``ux0``)
1. Edit ``ur0:tai/config.txt`` and comment out every plugin you use. F.e. (*download_enabler*, *nonpdrm*)
1. Copy *updater.vpk* to your memory card into the directory ``ux0:`` via VitaShell (FTP or USB)
1. Install the *updater.vpk* via VitaShell
1. Start the *3.65 HENkaku Ensō Updater* to check that the *PSP2UPDAT.PUP* is missing (Filesystem structure is now created)

1. Go to the `Settings` application and unlink your memory card via `Henkaku Settings` -> `Unlink Memory Card`

 + Don't run any other homebrew before the *3.65 HENkaku Ensō Updater*. In case you did, reboot your device and do Step 8. and 9. again.
